This is a computer graphics project where a 3d model of a car with searchlght is built using OpenGL (Open Graphics Library). OpenGL is an API which is a cross-platform application programming interface for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics. ![s](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36194333/94997782-2f029680-05cf-11eb-96b4-5444257c2695.JPG)
